    <h1>My Top 5 Favourite Games</h1>
    <h2>
      Hey, this is a simple list of 5 games that I think deserve the "best"
      title.
    </h2>
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Elden Ring</h3>
        <p>
          The GOAT of all Soulslike games. Amazing enviornments, bosses,
          exploration, simply a 10 out of 10 in all areas.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Minecraft</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone's childhood love. No matter how old I get, or how repetitive
          the game becomes at times, nostalgia keeps coming me back, especially
          if I've got my friends playing it too.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bioshock</h3>
        <p>
          The setup, the atmosphere, the truths, the lies, the world design and
          much more make me want to forget it all and experience it again.
          Simply a masterpiece.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>DOOM</h3>
        <p>
          Ngl, if demons killed my pet I'd go through hell and back to exact my
          revenge as well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>IGI</h3>
        <p>The one that started it all for me. Nothing beats your first one.</p>
    </li>
